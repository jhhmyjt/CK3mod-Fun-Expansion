Some fun decisions, events, traits, modifiers, nicknames and buildings

Trigger conditions: non-ai, adult character. 
The character will continue to be severely punished for a year, and will receive a powerful buff after the end
[b]Farewell to the world[/b]:
The character will die in a few days
[b]Inheritance ceremony: Durandal[/b]:
